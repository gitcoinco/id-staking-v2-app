          In using Passport, it's crucial that users have a foundational understanding of blockchain technology and the
          specific mechanisms we employ, such as staking and slashing, to maintain the integrity and security of the
          ecosystem. To assist with this, we provide access to a variety of resources:

    title: "Slashing Policy in Anti-Sybil Efforts",
    body: (
      <>
        <p>
          At Passport, maintaining the integrity and fairness of the ecosystem is a paramount concern. Central to this
          commitment is our robust anti-Sybil policy, aimed at preventing reward manipulation and ensuring equitable
          participation for all users. A fundamental aspect of this policy revolves around the use of Passport Stamps:
          each Stamp, regardless of its origin—be it web2 OAuth credentials (such as those from Discord or Google) or
          decentralized identity verifications (like Civic or Holonym)—is to be used exclusively within a single active
          Passport.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy is designed to deter Sybil attacks, where individuals might try to create multiple identities to
          unfairly skew outcomes or secure undue advantages. By instituting a clear and equitable rule, we stipulate
          that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <TosListItem>
            Each Stamp, a symbol of identity or affiliation verification, must remain unique to one Passport and cannot
            be reused or shared across multiple Passports.
          </TosListItem>
          <TosListItem>
            This rule is critical in safeguarding the ecosystem against attempts to manipulate the system, ensuring a
            fair and equitable environment for all participants.
          </TosListItem>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any infringement of this policy, such as the replication of a single Stamp across several Passports, will
          result in &apos;slashing&apos; penalties. These consequences can range from the loss of rewards to a reduction
          in staking benefits or other appropriate punitive measures. Slashing acts as a powerful deterrent against
          actions that compromise the ecosystem’s integrity and fairness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passport is dedicated to enforcing these rules rigorously, continuously updating our policies to guard against
          new forms of abuse or manipulation. Our aim is not merely to maintain a secure and trustworthy platform but to
          nurture a community where fairness and integrity reign supreme.
        </p>
        <p>
          By participating in the Passport ecosystem, you acknowledge and agree to comply with this policy, fully
          understanding the significance of these measures in protecting the integrity of our community.
